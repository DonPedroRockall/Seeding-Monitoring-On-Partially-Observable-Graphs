These tests were conducted in the following conditions:
    - Diffusion model: INDEPENDENT CASCADE
    - Distribution function (how to extract the nodes to delete): UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION
    - Hiding function (how to delete edges): TOTAL NODE CLOSURE
    - Edges' weights are initialized randomly for each of the 3 graphs. For future tests, we expect to maintain
      the same weights before and after KronFit
    - The values shown for each seed value k are the means computed over NUM_ITER iterations of the graph generation and
      KronFit: for each one of these, both Vote Rank and Basic Greedy algorithms are run NUM_RUN times and the means are
      computed
