These tests were conducted in the following conditions:
    - Diffusion model: INDEPENDENT CASCADE
    - Distribution function (how to extract the nodes to delete): UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION
    - Hiding function (how to delete edges): TOTAL NODE CLOSURE
    - Conditions are the same as Test_1, but now we make inference over graph parameters
